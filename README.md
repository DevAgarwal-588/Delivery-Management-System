# Delivery-Management-System
I made a Delivery-Management-System using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which uses the Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest path from all the routes available to reduce the time and the cost of travelling for the Delivery Boy.

In this project, we have only 1 restaurant, which is R. And all the other numbers represent Houses. We have two delivery boys (Boy1 and Boy2) (User can set their initial position) and a house where we need to deliver the food (User defined).
